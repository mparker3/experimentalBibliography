ZA WARWICK. Addressed t6 the Marquis of Hontley. X Should., my Lord, preface this history with an assurance of my feeling regret at sending it, since I know the sensible heart of him to whom it is addressed—If it occasions a few pangs to that heart, some tears may drop—I shall thank you for your pity—but much rather would 1 save your generous bosom from so distressful a visitant—and for ever bury from your knowledge a story replete with wretchedness and woe.—Lady Voi_ I. C Huntley, Huntley, my Lord; has desired me to point out to you the impossibility of our •ever being united—the most esfectual method of obeying her is to fend you the fad history of the unfortunate object that you would raise to the happiness of .becoming your wife—Behold, then, my Lord, I am ready to pass over once more the melancholy scenes of my life to do you service—scenes! which the bare recollection of throws my foul into agonies—yet, when I remember the motive of thus tearing open wounds which the lenient hand of Time had but just closed —when I remember that Lord Huntley is to be relieved from inquietude by my suffering afresh—I undertake the task with eagerness—every dart of sorrow this relation must cost me will in some measure be blunted by that reflection. • The cause in which 1 am engaged is a generous generous one; it may save your honour, their rise from love—the sacrisice I am going to make—will determine. My mother was the fourth daughter of the late Earl of Tenterdon—At the age of sixteen she was mistress of every accomplishment that could adorn her lex—The luxuriancy of beauty which even at that early period she possessed, rendered her the object of general admiration. Lady Tenterdon (whether through vanity, or a mistaken fondness for my mother) was anxious to exhibit the lovely Lady Eliza Darcey thus soon at Court. That point of ceremony, so important in the eye of Nobility, being attained, she was ushered immediately into the gay world.—At C 2 every every public place she constituted the •principal, part ,of admiration—The sinest spectacle—the finest singer—the sinest •actor—were disgregarded the moment Lady Eliza appeared. She was the idol of her father, and '" the fond -darling" (as Lady Tenterdon used to term it) ".' of her mother's heart."—Eliza 'was the.compass by which their most ambitious .hopes were steered, and they doubted not the safe pilot who would bring them into the .harbour they aimed at, by adding 10 their illustrious connections. The noise this new beauty made was not to be surpassed by the renown of the most valiant—-nor did Cæsar triumph over more conquests than did Lady Eliza Darcey—her slaves were as numerous as her disferent airs—and, surely, in one so young, and so admired., .many may be thought allowable. In the suite of her adorers the Duke of Beauvarise was not the most unheeded;, and,, if Lady Eliza felt no prepofsessibn in his favour,, it was enough. that Lord and Lady Tenterdon thought him* the most accomplished of men.—This nobleman; with an immense fortune,., had youth, fense, person, and merit,, to recommend him.—The refractory heart will often see objections' in an object, where they really do not exist—the Duke's. faults with. Lady Eliza were not few—and, as he was too much in love to prove, as good a rallier as her vivacity and insensibility to. his passion suffered her to. be, she treated, him with a degree of severity in her satire which nothing but the most fervent attachment on his side. could, have excused.. He proposed, himself to. the Earl as a match for his daughter, and* was joyfully accepted, of i an C 3 early early day for the celebration of nuptials^ which were to be the foundation of felicity to all but Eliza, was as eagerly granted by Lord Tenterdon as solicited for by the impatient Beauvarise. Lady Norfolk (my mother's second sister) .was about that time going down to her feat in Huntingdonshire; and Lady Eliza, during the drawing-up of settlements, and the preparations usual on such occasions, desired leave to attend her sister into the country. Now, my Lord, am I approaching a period in which I begin to feel myself asfected—a period on which the happiness of my honoured mother's life depended. Lady Norfolk was that fort of woman who strikes with admiration at the sirst view—her person was beautiful—in saying that that you bestowed on her the only encomium me merited—yet to accuse her of any flagrant crime would be unjust—her happiness centered in adoration, to every thing else me was insensible—to meet with that darling tribute to her charms,, she appeared continually in some dissipated scene—Neverr with her own consentr who, could sigure in so distinguished and attractive a line as she did— . This reflection consoled her, and they departed from town Norfolk-Mansion was the resort of the young and gay—Pleasure ruled with ab C 4 solute solute dominion, and each day was witness to the institution of some new entertainment. Lady Eliza, very unhappy from the change that was so soon to take place in her situation, wished for more retirement, and to be enabled to indulge her chagrin without controul—When she could steal a moment to herself, she reasoned with her heart Duty—gratitude —nay, ambition !—were urged to banish its insensibility—and every art used to inspire her soul with those sentiments of love which the Duke was but too justly entitled to—yet all were fruitless; they recoiled against the purpose they were intended to execute, and she never thought of the connection so soon to take place without souddering.—" I will write to my father," cried Lady Eliza one day, almost almost drowned in tears, "I will open my .soul to him, and own I am unhappy." Her pen was instantly employed— it addressed Lord Tenterdon in terms that would have moved the most indifferent to the woes of a fellow-creature—Alas! her situation was truly deplorable t she had no resource but in the mercy of a man who was impenetrable to the pleadings of Nature, when they were to clash with his ambition—and who on such occasions resembled in his feelings "A savage bred in Scythian wilds; soft humanizing Pity never reach'd his heart." Frequently was Lord Tenterdon heard to declare, he would prefer seeing his daugh ters dead at his feet, than behold them wedded to the worthiest men without titles and riches. His answer was therefore peremptory, and Lady Eliza received it with evident marks of horror. One day, tired of the incessant crofitf which hurried to Norfolk-Mansion, sEe complained of indisposition, and excused 1 herself from leaving her apartment.— About nine in the evening, when she thought every person engaged in the laloon,. Ihe was tempted by the serenity of the weather, and the brightness of the moon, to walk in those delightful woods which Lord Norfolk had taken much pains to render beautiful.—The trees were thick, and the beams that broke through them from the spangled horizon, and the charming orb which shone in its fullest splendour, for some time conspired to assist the sad turn of her mind, and gave her a taste of the voluptuousness of sorrow, which she eagerly indulged.—Weary at length with walking, she seated herself on the root » of a large lime, and charmed by a melodious nightingale that, had had perched on one of its branches, listened to its melancholy notes with enthusiastic pleasure.—Her sensibility, ever lively, ever exquisite, inspired in her breast the most delightful sensations, and she was nearly responsive to a song so soft— so accordant to the harmony of her own foul.—The charm did not continue—the bird flew from that side of the grove, and her ideas reaffumed their natural tendency—" Happy make thee! Cruel father! most unkind of men! you pofless not paternal feelings!"—A flood of tears prevented her saying more, and she was so totally absorbed in the .' idea idea of her wretchedness, that she perceived not a man standing before her, in. an attitude of astonishment and compassion—she started at the found of his. voice, when he thus exclaimed,. " Ah! Madam, 5 r ou seem overwhelmed with affliction; permit me to iatreat that those charming eyes may be dried,, and employ me on any occasion that can even in the slightest manner calm your anxiety— I am a man of honour; and, though a stranger to you, am authorised by that sacred title to say,, you may dare conside in me—My soul is humane—it never yet. harboured deceit, or availed itself of opportunity to hurt the innocent—judge, then, of the propriety of my sentiments towards you, and how I am asfected a« beholding so fair a creature a prey to that devouring monster Grief-—Say, Madam, how I can possibly relieve you—and my zeal ceal in serving you will best vouch the sincerity of my words." Lady Eliza was now struck with her imprudence—Fear sixed her torpid to her place whilst the stranger spoke—when he ended, a numerous croud of thoughts rushed on her mind, and distracted her with fear and confusion—that which disturbed her most was, that .she had partly revealed her secret to a man she never saw, and who might ungenerously use the discovery to her disadvantage.—Filled with this idea, stie quitted her feat, and with a tone of high disdain 'exclaimed, " Begone! bold intruder—begone, and seek no further to molest my retirement."—The stranger bowed low, and retreated, when for the sirst time Lady Eliza viewed him with less inattention than she had done, and in bis discovered the must perfect form feer.eye€ had ever beheld—•" Heavens!" said said Lady Eliza in a very low voice, "who is it I have thus addressed? What a savage must he think me! I will advance towards him—I will apologize."— She did fa—" Sir, 1 ought to ask your pardon" (cried the trembling beauty) '" for my incivility, and add my thanks for your generous offer—but, alas! I am unhappy—and no one on earth (but those who will not) can relieve me.— Adieu! Sir; forget this scene." She was hurrying from him, when the charming stranger caught hold of her hand, *' Rather ought I to implore your pardon, Madam, for my unseasonable interruption—but allow me to explain myself —I am an unfortunate man, entangled in an engagement the most cruel—My father has dragged me to Lord Norfolk's with the lady he has allotted for my bride—-Sick of the company, but most of of her, I came into these walks to indulge a chagrin too visible to be concealed— and hardly had I wandered ten minutes before I discovered you—Need I say more ?—I saw your sorrow—I heard your .pathetic exclamations—and, unable to contain myself longer, I dared to disturb your solitude—Forgive me, Madam; *tis I who should sue for forgiveness." Lady Eliza heard—and could have remained to listen, had he spoke for ages.— At length me begged him to fay no more on a subject that made her blush for her behaviour; and, after assuring him of her concern for his unhappy situation, told him her name—and begged to be informed of his. w My name, Madam, is Warwick—my father is a near neighbour of Lord Norfolk's, and with your permission I will call here to-morrow, and will hope to be favoured with a sight of the the most lovely woman in the universe.**' Lady Eliza would not accept of his at-* tendance to the house; and, half dead with fear and wonder, she made the best of her way to her own apartment.—* "Ah!" cried slie, throwing herself into a chair, "am I not indeed culpable ?-—' These emotions—the sound of that voice —Oh! Warwick—Who and what art thou ?—charming, generous rr.an! Your •griefs are equal to mine—our fate bears some resemblance." Aster such expressions, I need not say that Lady Eliza spent a disturbed and restless night: they are sussicient to evince she took some interest in Colonel Warwick's misfortunes. She arose early the next morning, dresled with a care and anxiety st;e knew not how to account for, and thought the hours the longest she had ever spent, when •Lady ..Norfolk entering her dr< sling- room,' .*' .Come, *' Come, Eliza," said she, " come down, and see the beauty and admiration of the world—Young Warwick, just arrived from Italy, with all the airs and graces that Nature can bestow, or Art acquire, comes thus often to my house, to shew his sense of the power of my charms: he was here yesterday, child—but you are so unaccountably dull—else you might have seen him sooner 1 must tell you a compliment he paid me—he took my hand as he was going away, and, looking at me very attentively, exclaimed, 'Beautiful Lady Norfolk! how much does the loveliest woman that Nature ever created resemble you! her eyes—her delicacy!' "An Italian, or a Parisian, I suppose?" 'No, faith—an English Divinity, my Lady.' "There's for you, Eliza—you see the poor man loves me— but I will keep him at a distance—He Vol. I. D has has never seen you yet, as he declared at dinner when Lord B. gave you as his toast—else I should think he meant that you were like me—you know, my dear, your eyes have been paid the compliment of being thought like mine." Thus she fan on, and might have done so much longer, without susfering any interruption from Lady Eliza, had not Lady Norfolk's impatience to see this Adonis put a period to her volubility. Her sister, with blushes, and a pleasing palpitation, consented to attend her into the drawingroom, where all the company were assembled. One glance towards a large pierglass, which reflected the whole of her sigure, gave her encouragement, and told her she was never more adorned for conquest. With trembling steps Lady Eliza followed Lady Norfolk into the room, not frot less agitated than the fair one whom he momently expected. As soon as the ladies entered, he approached with the .rest of the gentlemen to pay them the compliments of the morning, when Lord Norfolk, taking the hand of Col. Warwick, drew him up to Lady Eliza, and .begged leave to introduce him to her as •the friend of his earliest days. Susfer me, my Lord, to pass over the minutes—M:he fcours-'-that flew unperceived by these lovers, (for sincere ones they very soon became after this introduction,) until Lady Eliza received a command to return to town, importino. .that the Duke of Beauvarife was impatient to call her his. She wrote to her mother, to open to her the situation of her heart—she besought Lady Tenterdon to be her advocate with her father, and E 2 UI g e urge him to lay aside the cruel resolution of sacrisicing her to ambitious motives^— she declared her love for CoL Warwick, and concluded by assuring her Ladyship, Æhat nothing but death could tear his image from her heart. This letter exasperated ;both father and mother, and they sent Lord Westley (their eldest son) to attend her to town, and to carry their sinal answer to" this undutiful daughter," as they called her.. When Lord Westley arrived at Norfolk-Mansion, he addressed the gentle Eliza in the cruellest and harshest strainhe terrisied her with his unmanly threats, and swore he would challenge her lover, if she seemed the least reluctant to part from him. The noise and bustle, which this hotheaded young, ^an,. occasioned, j. Q drew xrrew Conversation^ for he had something of con sequence to deliver and communicate to him." 'Shew him in,' cried the transported Warwick, c he brings me tidings of my Eliza.' He prophesied truly. Lady Eliza had been cloisely consined on her arrival in town, and allowed to see no visitor but the Duke of Beauvarise. She considered that Nobleman's character—she knew there were some amiable traits in it—and, without reserve, frankly confessed to him tbe situation of her heart. —She implored him not only to defer the marriage, but to endeavour to convey a letter from her to Col. Warwick "Ah i Madam," replied the astonished Duke, "what is it you tell me? A rival !— a happy rival, too! Is it possible!" He traversed the roonf \n an agitation little short of phrenzy*-the afflicted •~ T . C ^' Eliza Eliza burst into tears—the sight of then*' were too affecting not to make an impression on the sensibility of Beauvarise—He paused, viewed her with attention, and y falling on his knees r exclaimed," Charming, amiable Eliza! for Heaven's fake let me not fee you weepTM Ah! pity me! —overcome not my resolutions—suffer me to hope." She arose, and turning from him, ' 1 ove me! Good God! can this be called love, to assist in making me miserable ?—No, my Lord, so generous a passion your bosom is.a stranger to.' "I will convince you, Madam," (replied the unfortunate Beauvarife)" that I am not the selsish monster you take me for—No—I will obey you, though you command me to bring him to you— though you exact of me the painful task of bestowing you on him 1 will fly, Madam—I will seek out this happy lover you see me the victim of your cruelty." As he ended he wiped a tear from either eye, and besought her with composure to employ him in her service.- Lady Eliza was penetrated with sorrow—but reflecting on this opportunity as the only one perhaps she should ever gain of forwarding her wishes—with many tears, apologies, and encomiums on his exalted way of thinking, she intrusted the amiable Beauvarise with a letter to CoL Warwick. —' Inquire for him, my Lord,' cried Eliza, 'at every stage between this and Warwick-Hall, for I make no doubt he is on the road to London.' The Duke received the packet with emotion; and, after assuring her he would be faithful to . • , I hia Ms trust, quitted Lord TenterdonY house' With precipitation. "Ah \ what am 1 about to do?* said he, as soon as he retired; '* to resign the most desirable object in the world—nay, more—to seek for my rival, and meditate with him how to secure he's to him 1 shudder at the idea—I never can accomplish it Merciful Heaven? what a trial!—• — Yet is it hot incumbent on me to be generous ?—Shall Beauvarise' suffer a lowminded selsishness to prevent his making one effort that (though it costs him dear) will give happiness to the woman he adores? 1 cannot hesitate—Dear Eliza? I must not abuse your considence— your peace shall be preferred to my own." When tne Duke got home, he ordered a hired chaise' and horses,' and without an attendant' sat a &ff immediately for Huntingdonshire— saw Lady Tenterdon get into her chair, they expected to be called immediately—but the the Duke's house being quiet, (the company having all separated by six,) and sinding it to no purpose to remain any longer, they came home to rest, making no doubt but that they should hear tidings of Lady Eliza at their return. Lady Tenterdon, when she was dressed, sent to desire her daughter to attend her and her Lord at breakfast, in her dressing-room. Her woman hesitated— "You do not hear me," cried her Ladyship. 'Lady Eliza did not lodge at home last night, my Lady.'—" Not lodge at home ! Was there ever such stupidity L Do you go, (turning to another of her maids)—do you endeavour to understand this command 1" 'Ah! my Lady,' exclaimed the affrighted Abigail, ' what Storer tells you is really true; Lady Eliza did not come home last night—she is, I suppose, with one of our young sadies.* -—-Lady Tenterdon Was wild with her presages—" What is it you tell me P* cried she; "my daughter not returned t —Gracious HeaVen! what can have become of her!—Dispatch messengers to Lady Emily Colville's—Lady Harriet Pelham's—she must be with one of her sisters Where are her servants ?—the men who attended her.?—they can inform us." Their story was related Half dead with terror, she flew to Lord Tenterdon, and found him writing in his closet—She informed him of her fears, and asked his opinion^^-He replied, 'Lady Eliza was gone to his daughter Emily's, and she need not alarm herself.' —But when the messengers returned frorti Lady Colville's and Lady Pelham's, with an account of and inquired for him—The servant, who opened a parlour-door, and begged him to enter, informed him "that his Grace had fat off for one of his country-seats that very morning, by break of day." What perplexities! They could form no idea of Eliza's fate—But Lord Tenterdon, unwilling to believe his favourite scheme would prove abortive, pretended to be welt convinced that she was with some female friend in London, and would be at home very shortly. All that day they were tortured with fuspence—They concluded, that, if me designed to let Col. Warwick into the secret of her elopement, she could not do it in lese than twenty-four E 4 hours; The Colonel, Lady Eliza, and her saithful domestic, arrived, "after many fears of being overtaken, at the place <sf destination; and there these faithful lovers immediately parted with their liberty, without one regret—Lady Eliza, •indeed, often' sighed at' the resentment she must experience from her family-^but the idea of their cruelty, in meaning to make a sacrisice of her, in spite of all her tears and intreaties, vindicated her conduct in her" own eyes—She was not • Vol. 1.^"" l ".' F 'destitute .destitute of hope that the Duke would rbe a successful intercessor with Lord and Lady Tenterdon, and anticipated the joy she should feel at being restored to their favour.—These reflections calmed her spirits, and in a little while she considered herself as the happiest of her sex..—Ah! how little could she foresee the calamities that were so near overwhelming her !— The blackest prospects were .gathering around, and the short sun-shine that illumined her nuptials only gave an increase of horror to her :situation when ingulfed in the storms of Fate. After a fortnight spent in Scotland, in which time they received no intelligence from the Duke, they determined .to return to England, and know what they were to expect from Lord Tenterdon. Warwick did not suppose his father would .ever sver part with a shilling towards their support; hqwever, on his marriage, he wrote him a very respectful letter, and acquainted him with his connection, which he hoped '* would not offend the father, since it made the son happy." Sir William made no reply to this—but some days after mentioned, in the hearing of .a friend of Col. Warwick, that " he never would take any nqtice of the imprudent yquth, who had forfeited a sine fortune by his folly, and with it his affection for ever;" adding, practice." When the new-married pair arrived in London, they sent to the Duke of Beau varise, begging to see him, as soon as his ,«pnvenLency would permit them that F 2 pleasure— •pleasure—This amiable friend flew im.mediately to Col. Warwick's lodgings, and there with insinite reluctance he revealed the whole of 'Lord Tenterdon f s 'behaviour: "Sorry am I," said the excellent Beauvarise, " to give a moment's uneasiness to persons whom love and honour conspired to render happy; bus, alas! those two noble sentiments, though they may contribute towards felicity, do not always insure it—and Lord Tenterdon's restless ambition has power sussicient to deprive them of their just reward—he is inexorable—he is unnatural—he forgets'humanity While he prophefieswretchedness—and he shuts close his heart when he foretels poverty Weep not, beautiful Eliza," cried he, with emotion— "those tears affect me too deeply—Ah! my God! is it my fate ever to give you uneasiness ?——My fortune—^my interest —shall —shall be employed in the service of* our Warwick—nor shall he, or his, ever know the stings of indigence, as your illiberal father portends." 'My Lord,* cried the agitated Eliza,. ' spare my father !—I have no reason to condemn him. —he holds me culpable, and that I merit his resentment My Warwick—
